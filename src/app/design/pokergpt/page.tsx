              <p>
                To take poker seriously means needing a professional poker
                coach. But getting a coach is expensive and inaccessible to
                many. What if there was a way to solve this problem with the
                emerging opportunity of generative AI?

          <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            Intermediate to advanced poker players often seek the guidance of a
            coach to enhance their skills. However, such coaches are not always
            readily available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team embarked on a mission to create an AI poker coach,
            recognizing the potential of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, as
            a inflection for our business. During development, we found that the
            evolving advancements in prompt chaining played a crucial role in
            shaping this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to note that our company was facing challenges due to
            the economic recession at the time, necessitating a rapid source of
            revenue. This posed a significant challenge: we needed to launch
            within a few days and create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in
            just a few weeks.

            <h3>Empathizing with Users</h3>
            <p>
              Starting this project, one glaring hurdle stood out: I barely knew
              anything about poker. To design a tool genuinely useful for our
              target users, I had to walk a mile in their shoes. So, I embarked
              on a crash course, learning the basics of poker and engaging in
              games with my team. Additionally, I maintained regular
              consultations with our product owner, tapping into his insights as
              a semi-professional player, ensuring that our AI coach would be
              both intuitive and impactful for users.

          <h3>Gathering Requirements and Defining the Scope</h3>
          <p>
            Given our tight deadline, it became imperative to define a clear-cut
            MVP. Our CEO, a key stakeholder who happens to be both an AI
            enthusiast and a semi-professional poker player, had already
            validated the technical feasibility and market demand for our idea.
            As the developers dived deep into the AI model's intricacies, I took
            on the task of designing the overall user flow and sketching out
            wireframes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wireframes went through a few iterations as we really had to
            boil it down to just the necessary elements, adhering to strictly
            what was needed for the mvp

        <h3>Visual Branding</h3>
        <p>
          We needed something that screamed modern, exciting, yet professional.
          I opted for a minimalist branding with light and vibrant colours,
          differentiating PokerGPT from existing poker solutions and offering a
          friendly and welcoming interface.
