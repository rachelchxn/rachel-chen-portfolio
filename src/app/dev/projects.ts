      "Starving, loathing oneself, and constantly facing traumatic reminders was my daily reality for years. Many, especially those with body dysmorphia and eating disorders, grapple with these triggers daily. ZenSphere aims to offer a safer web experience, allowing users to block personal triggers and navigate online spaces with ease. We believe in a tailored approach, understanding that everyone's triggers are unique. \n\nZenSphere steps into the freshly opened webpage, takes a breath, and starts working: \n  1. It scrapes through every image and sentence on the page, checking if it is a potential trigger for the user (using co.classify) \n  2. It blurs all flagged images automatically, but with one click of a button, the user may reveal the image \n  3. All flagged text either gets blocked or described in neutral words (co.generate), depending on user's settings \n  4. ZenSphere takes a breather before the user moves on to another page, always ready to pounce on threats to the user's mental health!",
